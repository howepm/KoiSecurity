#KoiSecurity
A better readme will be coming very soon.

For now, you can either include the library and then:

using KoiSecurity;
KoiSecurity = new KoiSecurity();

This will output the about me/read me

You can also just do KoiSecurity.About(); instead of calling a new class.

Alternatively, for now, read the file at

    KoiSecurity/KoiSecurity.cs

Even a non-programmer should be able to make sense of the Console.WriteLines :)
