#DWTFYL License - Version 1
##Do Whatever The Fuck You Like License 

I didn't want to weigh up other licenses to decide what would be best and to
be honest, I don't care what you use this code for.

It would be nice if you linked to either my github or my website:

* [My website, Howe.PM](http://howe.pm/)
* [My GitHub, HowePM](https://github.com/howepm)

Preferably both, and if only one, my website please.

There are no other restrictions on what you can do with this code, personally
or commercially.

Other people are free to use this license but DO NOT remove my website or
github links, even if it's your own project. There is a section at the end
of the license file that allows you to do self promotion and update the license
for that purpose in that area and that area alone.

Have at it!

##Random legal crap

This license is subject to change. I don't know why I'd do that, but I may
update it. However, code (or whatever product this is bundled with) is licensed
with the terms of the *included* license. So if I, for example, ban the use of
this library in F# projects, that change *only* applies to changes *after* the
license updates. Spelling and grammar errors don't negate anything in this
document, it's clear what my intentions are.

I would rather you didn't fork it and wrote your own license, but I don't
particularly care. Feel free. Do fork it though if you're changing the terms
so people don't get us confused, and change the name.

Alternatively, let's say your name is Tom. You could change

#DWTFYL License - Version 1

to

#DWTFYL License - Toms Version 1

Just don't have people confusing our licenses :)

###Tldr

License may change but you are only bound by the terms you're reading here.

##Self promotion

You may freely edit the license from here downwards to add promotion for the
product you're bundling this license with but *please do not alter above here*
